	\note{Let me give you a quick overview of today’s presentation. We’ll begin with the Introduction, 
          outlining the problem and motivation behind predicting stock prices using deep learning. Next,
          in Related Work, we’ll explore existing research and why models like LSTM and BiGRU are 
          particularly promising for time series data.

          Then, I’ll walk you through our Proposed Method, which involves combining these models into a 
          hybrid architecture. This leads into the Results, where we evaluate performance using standard 
          metrics. In Discussion, we’ll analyze the outcomes and key insights.
          
          Finally, we’ll close with the Conclusion, summarizing findings and highlighting potential 
          directions for future work. Let’s get started.}
