\section{Introduction} 

\begin{frame}[label=stockpred]{Why Predict Stock Prices?}
	\begin{itemize} 	
		\item Stock prediction offers \emph{high potential returns}
        \item Financial markets are \alert{noisy and nonlinear}
        \item Forecasting aids decision-making
        \item Hybrid models \alert{(LSTM + GRU) improve accuracy and efficiency}
        \item \emph{Technical indicators enhance deep learning performance}
	\end{itemize}
	\note{
        Stock market prediction has always attracted attention due to its potential for significant 
        financial gain. Historically, investors used fundamental and technical analysis to guide 
        decisions, but these traditional methods often struggle with the high volatility and complexity 
        of financial time series.
        
        With advances in deep learning, models like LSTM have gained traction. LSTMs are a type of 
        recurrent neural network specifically designed to retain long-term dependencies in sequential 
        data, making them well-suited for modeling stock prices.

        These models are further enhanced when combined with technical indicators—such as MACD, RSI, 
        Bollinger Bands, and SMA—which provide insight into historical trends and market momentum.
        
        Furthermore, combining LSTM with GRU—a simpler, more efficient recurrent unit—has shown promise in 
        improving both training speed and predictive accuracy. This project explores the effectiveness of 
        LSTM and hybrid LSTM–GRU architectures in forecasting stock prices, specifically for Workday Inc.

    \begin{block}{Why Choose WDAY?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mid-cap tech stock with significant volatility
            \item Less media coverage compared to large tech companies
            \item Realistic, high-noise environment for testing predictive models
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{alertblock}{Key Point}
        WDAY’s volatility and underexplored market behavior make it an ideal 
        candidate to validate deep learning forecasting models.
    \end{alertblock}

    \note{
        Workday Inc., or WDAY, is a mid-cap technology stock that experiences 
        significant price volatility.
        Unlike the major tech giants such as Apple or Amazon, WDAY receives 
        relatively less media attention,
        which often leads to less predictable price movements.

        This combination of moderate size, high volatility, and limited analyst 
        focus makes WDAY an excellent 
        candidate for testing the strength of predictive models. It offers a more 
        realistic and challenging 
        environment compared to heavily analyzed, lower-noise stocks.

        In short, WDAY provides the perfect blend of unpredictability and 
        complexity to validate our deep learning models.

\begin{frame}[label=problemstatement]{Problem Statement }
    \begin{block}{Research Focus}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Forecast next-day closing price of \href{https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/wday}{Workday Inc. (WDAY)} using deep learning
            \item Address limitations of traditional methods in volatile, nonlinear financial markets
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{alertblock}{Objective}
        Develop and compare LSTM and LSTM-BiGRU models to minimize prediction errors, identify short-term trends, and support informed decision-making.
    \end{alertblock}

    \note{
        This project focuses on forecasting the next-day stock closing price of Workday Inc. (WDAY) using advanced deep learning techniques.
        Given the increasing volatility and complexity of financial markets, traditional approaches often fail to capture the nonlinear dynamics involved.

        The core objective is to develop and compare two deep learning architectures—LSTM and BiGRU—in predicting WDAY's next-day closing price.
        The goal is not only to minimize forecasting errors but also to uncover actionable short-term trends.

        Additionally, this research explores how such deep learning forecasts could be integrated into real-time applications like algorithmic trading systems or financial monitoring tools.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Predict \alert{next-day stock close price of 
            \href{https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/wday}{Workday 
            Inc. (WDAY)} using LSTM and LSTM-BiGRU architectures}
            \item Use daily stock market data covering approximately the last 
            \alert{10 years}
            \item Dataset includes pricing data (Open, Close, Volume) and 
            technical indicators (Moving Averages, Volume Traded, RSI)
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Evaluation and Conclusion}
        Model performance will be assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R² score), followed by a analysis and conclusions.
    \end{exampleblock}

    \note{
        In this project, I aim to predict the next-day closing price of Workday
        Inc. using deep learning models—specifically LSTM and a hybrid 
        LSTM–BiGRU architecture.
        The input data will consist of daily stock prices and technical 
        indicators collected over the past 10 years.

        To measure the success of the models, I will evaluate them using RMSE, 
        MAE, and R² score.
        Finally, conclusions will be drawn based on the performance results, with 
        discussions about the effectiveness of these architectures for short-term 
        stock forecasting.
    
        The data will be collected from a rest api provided for TwelveData Api
